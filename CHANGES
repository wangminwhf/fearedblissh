2.0.0
-------
- Relicensed back to the Mozilla Public License 2.0
- Completely restructured the application in order to fully support both the cleaning
  of btrfs and zfs snapshots.
- Merged the 'btrfs' functionality from the bliss-btrfs-scripts into this one
  to have one code base.
- Improved message output
- Fixed a small bug where if you passed the "-h" flag, it wouldn't just show you the -h,
  but still run a small amount of code.
- The speed for which the script will retrieve the zfs snapshots on a system has been vastly increased
  by taking advantage of the "-s" flag for "zfs list".
