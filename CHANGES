1.0.1
----------
clean_snapshots:
- Fixed a bug where the cleaner would delete snapshots that were equal to and
  older than the 30th day. Example: If today was 5/1/13, it would delete the
  4/1/13 snapshot. It is only suppose to delete anything _older_ than 4/1/13,
  not anything older _and_ equal to 4/1/13.
- Fixed the explanation of a comment since it was confusing.
