2.1.0
-------
== overall ==
- Changed the date format of the snapshots to be "YYYY-mm-dd-HHMM-ss" rather than "mm_dd_YY". This was done to
  provide extremely fast sorting for the zfs list -t snapshot -s name -o name -H command. This new format should
  also allow one to easily sort with the Linux 'sort -n' utility for both zfs and btrfs filesystem snapshots.

  For existing users, I've provided a 'snapshot_renamer' utility that will allow you to rename all of your current
  snapshots to the new format. This utility can be found in the 'migration' folder.

  * Note, this renamer is only for zfs. No btrfs renamer will be provided.

- Updated documentation, example, etc respectively

== clean_snapshots ==
  > Fixed a bug where if the month was january, then rolling back 30 days would not roll back to the correct year.
  > Removed some unused code

== zfs_backup ==
  > Refactored to improve overall layout and remove DRY (There were multiple functions that did similar things).
  > The backup script is now using "-s" for retrieving snapshots which also increases the retrieval of snapshots to
    near O(1) times (or at least it feels that way :D).
  > Reduced amount of unnecessary output information
  > Fixed a bug where if the dataset to backup wasn't found, the program would still try to run
  > The program will ask you for confirmation before continuing. You can skip the confirmation by passing the "-f" flag.
  > Only one dataset will be allowed to be passed to the script at a time. Use the flags -b <backup pool> -d <dataset> to set locations.

2.0.0
-------
- Relicensed back to the Mozilla Public License 2.0
- Completely restructured the application in order to fully support both the cleaning
  of btrfs and zfs snapshots.
- Merged the 'btrfs' functionality from the bliss-btrfs-scripts into this one
  to have one code base.
- Improved message output
- Fixed a small bug where if you passed the "-h" flag, it wouldn't just show you the -h,
  but still run a small amount of code.
- The speed for which the script will retrieve the zfs snapshots on a system has been vastly increased
  by taking advantage of the "-s" flag for "zfs list".
