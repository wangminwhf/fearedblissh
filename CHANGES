2.3.0
------
- Added tag support in the zfs/tank_snapshot scripts. This allows you to better organize
 your snapshots by adding any tag you want. Something like 'HOURLY', 'DAILY', 'WEEKLY', 'YEARLY.

- Added support for the 'time' section of the snapshots in the cleaner. This allows you to not
  only delete snapshots up to a specific date, but also a specific time.

  Example: Delete all snapshots until August 5th, 2015 @ 5:00 PM
           clean_snapshots -t zfs -p tank -d 2015-08-05-1700

- Updated the cron list in the EXAMPLEs file so that you can easily set up the
  snapshots tags at the various times during the year.

2.2.2
------
- Fixed main script 'zfs', 'zpool', and 'btrfs' commands to use their full path so that they
  can be used in cronjobs with 'no command not found' errors.

2.2.1
------
- Fixed regression where the btrfs command to delete snapshots became broken.

2.2.0
-------
- Implemented a massive performance improvement to the clean_snapshots for zfs.
  It is now using the comma-delimited feature that the zfs destroy command supports.
  Rather than using the previous implementation of getting each snapshot in the list
  of snapshots to remove and calling zfs destroy on it individually, we are now
  building a list of snapshots for the same dataset that need to be deleted, and passing
  it into one zfs destroy command call. This enables the zfs destroy command to have a better
  perspective of all the snapshots it will remove, and let it remove all of the snapshots
  extremely quickly.

  In order to deal with the ARG_MAX limit that shells/exec have, I've made it so that every 5000
  snapshots, it "flushes" its buffer and trigger the zfs destroy command. 5000 was used because
  for 'bliss-zfs-scripts', the snapshots are named: YYYY-mm-dd-HHMM-ss, + a comma to separate, + let's say
  50 characters for w/e the base dataset name is, 95050~ characters.

  The limit seems to be 2097152 (I did a getconf ARG_MAX on my Gentoo Linux system with bash) and the
  max argument string length seems to be 131072 (at least from what the below website says starting at 2.6.23).

  http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/argmax/

  Thus it seems that 5000 seems to be a good safe limit for most usages.

2.1.0
-------
== overall ==
- Changed the date format of the snapshots to be "YYYY-mm-dd-HHMM-ss" rather than "mm_dd_YY". This was done to
  provide extremely fast sorting for the zfs list -t snapshot -s name -o name -H command. This new format should
  also allow one to easily sort with the Linux 'sort -n' utility for both zfs and btrfs filesystem snapshots.

  For existing users, I've provided a 'snapshot_renamer' utility that will allow you to rename all of your current
  snapshots to the new format. This utility can be found in the 'migration' folder.

  * Note, this renamer is only for zfs. No btrfs renamer will be provided.

- Updated documentation, example, etc respectively

== clean_snapshots ==
  > Fixed a bug where if the month was january, then rolling back 30 days would not roll back to the correct year.
  > Removed some unused code

== zfs_backup ==
  > Refactored to improve overall layout and remove DRY (There were multiple functions that did similar things).
  > The backup script is now using "-s" for retrieving snapshots which also increases the retrieval of snapshots to
    near O(1) times (or at least it feels that way :D).
  > Reduced amount of unnecessary output information
  > Fixed a bug where if the dataset to backup wasn't found, the program would still try to run
  > The program will ask you for confirmation before continuing. You can skip the confirmation by passing the "-f" flag.
  > Only one dataset will be allowed to be passed to the script at a time. Use the flags -b <backup pool> -d <dataset> to set locations.

2.0.0
-------
- Relicensed back to the Mozilla Public License 2.0
- Completely restructured the application in order to fully support both the cleaning
  of btrfs and zfs snapshots.
- Merged the 'btrfs' functionality from the bliss-btrfs-scripts into this one
  to have one code base.
- Improved message output
- Fixed a small bug where if you passed the "-h" flag, it wouldn't just show you the -h,
  but still run a small amount of code.
- The speed for which the script will retrieve the zfs snapshots on a system has been vastly increased
  by taking advantage of the "-s" flag for "zfs list".
