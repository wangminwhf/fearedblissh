This is an example crontab. I will use mine as an example:

# Run a scrub every week at 05:00 on Sunday
00 05 * * 0 /usr/local/sbin/zpool_scrub tank

# Takes a snapshot every five minutes (See the tank_snapshot file)
*/5 * * * * /usr/local/sbin/tank_snapshot

# Check the pool health twice a day
00 00,12 * * * /usr/local/sbin/check_zfs_pool

# Backup your datasets to a target pool once a day (See the tank_backup file)
# 05 00 * * * /usr/local/sbin/tank_backup

# Clean snapshots once a month (I don't use this since in the cronjob,
# since I do manual backups and need a common snapshot to do incremental backups)
# I only clean my snapshots after I've updated my backup pools.
# 05 01 01 * * /usr/local/sbin/clean_snapshots -f -p tank -t zfs
