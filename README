Bliss ZFS Scripts 3.6.0

This is a collection of scripts that I use to manage my zfs setup at home.
Customize the scripts to your needs!

1) zfs_snapshot        - Takes a snapshot of a dataset
2) clean_snapshots     - Prints out message to the new Rust-based cleaner: https://github.com/fearedbliss/Honeydew
3) check_zfs_pool      - Checks the pools health. If degraded, it sends you an email
4) zpool_scrub         - Scrubs the pool
5) zfs_backup          - Backs up your datasets automatically (simple replication to another pool)
