This is a collection of scripts that I use to manage my zfs setup at home.

1) zfs_snapshot        - Takes a snapshot of a dataset
2) clean_snapshots     - Deletes snapshots older than 30 days or older than a date set by the user
3) check_zfs_pool      - Checks the pools health. If degraded, it sends you an email
4) zpool_scrub         - Scrubs the pool
5) zfs_backup          - Backs up your datasets automatically (replication to another pool)

--
Example scripts that would be called from your crontab
*) tank_snapshot       - Wrapper around zfs_snapshot
*) tank_backup         - Wrapper around zfs_backup

--
*) debug/*                    - Files used for various debugging purposes

--
Note: Some of the tools also provide btrfs support. However at the moment, ZFS is the main focus for these scripts.

These scripts can be used as cronjobs.

Requirements:
Python 3+
bash
