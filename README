This is a collection of scripts that I use to manage my zfs setup at home.

1) zfs_snapshot        - Takes a snapshot of a dataset
2) btrfs_snapshot      - Takes a snapshot of all subvolumes under your toplevel path (excludes "snapshots" subvolume)
2) clean_snapshots     - Deletes snapshots older than 30 days or older than a date set by the user (also supports btrfs)
3) check_zfs_pool      - Checks the pools health. If degraded, it sends you an email
4) zpool_scrub         - Scrubs the pool
5) zfs_backup          - Backups up your datasets automatically
