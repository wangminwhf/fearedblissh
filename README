This is a collection of scripts that I use to manage my zfs setup at home.

1) zfs_snapshot        - Takes a recursive snapshot of your pool
2) clean_snapshots     - Deletes snapshots older than 30 days
3) check_zfs_pool      - Checks the pools health. If degraded, it sends you an email
4) zpool_scrub         - Scrubs the pool

These scripts are designed to be used as cronjobs.
